Date: 5/12/2023

In this project, weâ€™ll use Java to write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or strange).
Mad Libs require: A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words). Words from the player to fill in those blanks.
